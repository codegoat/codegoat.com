            <h3>Lead Software Engineer ~ KIXEYE ~ 2013-Present</h3>
		<p>At KIXEYE I have been a leader for a major refactor and development phase of the <a href="http://www.kixeye.com">KIXEYE.com</a> gaming portal. KIXEYE.com was refactored into a single page javascript app so that users are able to browse the portal (chat, groups, leaderboards, guides, content) while maintaining their current play session. </p>
		<p>Some features have been added recently that have had a large impact on moving players from playing within Facebook to playing within the gaming portal. Payments are now generalized to all games instead of being specifically written by individual games. A game running in the portal can send events to the portal which then responds by providing the user access to the payment provider then communicating back to the game upon successful purchase of game credit. Chat and Groups support have had a positive response from our users. When we added chat functionality to the portal, it was the first module to be written in Backbone. The team liked Backbone and we have since refactored the entire KIXEYE.com portal to use Backbone and Backbone.Marionette.</p>

            <h3>Front End Developer ~ Semadic ~ 2012-2013</h3>
		<p>When I joined the Semadic team, they had already developed an advanced prototype for the startup venture. My goal was to take the front end technologies from a quickly thrown together prototype into a competent and well designed system for production delivery. In 7 months we delivered the full production product that now runs <a href="http://victoria.diggit.ca">victoria.diggit.ca</a>, <a href="http://www.begiving.ca">www.begiving.ca</a> and <a href="http://www.gobid.ca">www.gobid.ca</a>.</p>

		<p>The monetization goal of the venture required that the product be capable of rebranding in a short timeframe. We were able to design for this requirement by utilizing modern separation techniques and frameworks. Bootstrap, SASS and jQuery were used extensively.</p>

            <p>I was hired as a Programmer Analyst on a team responsible for a market analysis and data visualization tool. I was promoted to Senior Technical Lead in Fall 2011, and was placed in charge of the Product team which manages all user interfacing applications.</p>
            <p>The majority of my work focused on user interfaces, but I also maintained the iOS app, Postgres C Extension and SOAP API.  I was part of the team responsible for porting the product to a new dataset, adding UTF8 support for international market data. I was also involved in the development of two prototypes.  The first was a mobile app for doing market research on-the-go developed using jQuery Mobile and PhoneGap with barcode scanning plugin.  The second prototype was a web application that did display and analysis of data from independent sales channels for online retailers.</p>
